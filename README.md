# ML-Challenge
* Sample.csv is our problem dataset.
* Basic data analysis is implemented in DataAnalysis.py script.
* Neural Network model and k-fold cross validation was implemented in Model.py script.
* Neural Network model and k-fold cross validation was implemented in ModelWithSampler.py script but also 
Oversampling minority class is implemented to solve class imbalance problem of our dataset. This is the final model.
* Model.py script was included only to show what problem we face due to class imbalance problem.
* Model.py script was included only to show what problem we face due to class imbalance problem.
* Report.pdf contains all the strategies and results.
